GeneratedPageInformation=The generated patients will have names and dates of birth corresponding to US population distribution. Addresses and zip codes are within the US roughly in proportion to US demographics. Patients may have been diagnosed with a disease many years ago but the data represented in this account will only go back 10 years or so. Not all pregnancies and not all diagnoses result in data being generated. This accounts for people that go elsewhere for care or decide not to seek further care. They are generated roughly in proportion to the US population.
