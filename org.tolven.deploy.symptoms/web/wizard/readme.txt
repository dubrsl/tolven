This folder contains wizard pages. All wizard pages should extend wizTemplate.xhtml, 
which also can be overridden in this folder.

To avoid conflicts with other files that might be merged to this folder, consider using a sub-folder
using your plugin id for those files uniquely yours.
A file in this folder with the same name as a file in the Tolven core will override the default.
