This folder contains the xhtml template pages used by Tolven. Overriding pages in this folder has the broadest 
impact on the application as a whole, especially portalTemplate.xhtml.

To avoid conflicts with other files that might be merged to this folder, consider using a sub-folder
using your plugin id for those files uniquely yours.
A file in this folder with the same name as a file in the Tolven core will override the default.
