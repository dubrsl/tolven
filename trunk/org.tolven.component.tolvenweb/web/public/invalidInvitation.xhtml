		<p>While the user Id and password you entered are valid, you are not logged into Tolven. 
		The first time that you log into Tolven requires authentication. Authentication is done to ensure privacy.
		Although Tolven does not send health data through eMail, it must ensure that you are you and more importantly
		that someone else is not posing as you.</p>
		<p>In order to complete the activation process, wait for the email and click on the link provided in
		that message. </p>
		<p>If you do not get the activation within #{top.properties['tolven.register.expiration']/60} minutes, Tolven will automatically 
		delete the login you created and you will be able to register again with the same email address (user Id).</p>
