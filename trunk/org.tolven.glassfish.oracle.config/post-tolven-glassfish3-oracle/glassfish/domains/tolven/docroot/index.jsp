	<h3>Tolven Server</h3>
	<p>You have reached the Tolven server. To log into the tolven application, 
	click on the link below. You may also want to bookmark the 
	URL below for convenient future access to Tolven.</p>
	<a href="/Tolven">Tolven Login</a>
	<h3>A note about security</h3>
	<p>When you click on the link to login, the Tolven server and your browser will negotiate a private 
	communication channel. Among other things, this provides you an assurance that the
	server is authentic -- assuming that you verify the authenticy by clicking on the padlock 
	or other icon provided on your browser.</p>
	<p>If the server you are about to connect to is provided for demonstration or testing, it probably will 
	not have a valid certificate and thus your browser may report that the server should not be trusted. 
	While you should indeed be cautious and not enter private information, you may have been
	asked to access the software for the purpose of evaluation or testing prior to a "go live" on a
	server that does have a valid digital certificate.</p>
	<h3>Technical</h3>
	<p>Tomcat will redirect to this page if the Tolven application is not currently listening.
	Likewise, clicking Tolven Login above could return to this page indicating the same thing.
	</p>
	<p>This page is not actually part of the Tolven application. Therefore, it can be used 
	to dispatch to various applications managed by the same application server. Or it can be safely removed
	or replaced with another page if needed.</p>
